in this game you will be rolling dice with the "Gamemaster" and your aim is to get a total of 20 or more points. You will get a total of
6 turns and on each turn you will get the choice between keeping the dice or rolling the dice. should you choose to roll the dice you will
"roll" an integer between 1 and 6. whatever number you roll will be directly added to your score. Should you decide to keep the dice the 
"Gamemaster" will roll a dice generating an integer between 1 and 6. If the number the "Gamemaster" rolls is even then the player earns
points worth double the "Gamemasters" roll, otherwise the player earns 0 points for that turn.
